Should run under Unix or Windows (assuming correct packages are installed). See [getting started with GTK#](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/beginners-guide/).
There is a [docker build available](https://github.com/willb611/SlimeSimulationDocker), but this only works on Ubuntu installations currently (other *nix-based operating systems are untested but might work).
